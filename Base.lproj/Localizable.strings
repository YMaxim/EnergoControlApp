ourScientificWork2 = "   At the moment there is a whole series of single-phase and three-phase meters, ranging from simple basic modifications to Smart meters, which allows to automate the collection of readings from meters.";
ourScientificWork3 = "   The main emphasis in the designing of our products is made on high quality, reliability, functionality, the ease of adjustment and installation, and modern design. In addition, we always try to improve the production, increase its cost-effectiveness in order to make our devices as accessible to the end user as possible.";
ourScientificWork4 = "   To achieve maximum quality and protect our meters from climatic factors and from unauthorized access of dishonest consumers, special devices for diagnosing meters have been developed. The testing of new components of meters is carried out on a monthly, which allow us to choose only high-quality parts and materials for manufacturing our products.";
ourScientificWork5 = "   Our team consists of experienced in the energy sphere professionals, as well as young specialists, which insures the most efficient use of advanced technologies in the development of energy meters.";
